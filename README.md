# Acumen Frontend Homework

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

We would like you to create an live NPM dependency tree. The features it should include:

 - [ ] Input a specific NPM package name.
 - [ ] Per package, fetch its information from NPM (`https://registry.npmjs.org/${PACKAGE_NAME}`)
 - [ ] Display the top level dependencies for the package via a tree
 - [ ] When clicking on a dependency, show its dependencies (tree expands)
 - [ ] The project should include a basic `README.md` on how to run the project

#### Extra credit features

 - [ ] Autocomplete of package name input
 - [ ] "Get entire tree" option, which expands the entire tree in one click
 - [ ] Polish and UX
 - [ ] Highly reusable components
 - [ ] Tests

## Requirements

You should use the following tools to accomplish this task:

 - React / Angular
 - MobX
 - TypeScript (latest)

If you have any questions, please ask!
